#Behavior

Control you motor with a transistor

Skill Demo 5b
Hook up the motor to your Arduino with the L293D H-bridge. 
 
Write a program to drive the motor in a loop: 
● forward 2 seconds
● pause for 2 seconds
● reverse 2 seconds
● stop for 2 seconds.  
You will probably want to attach something to the motor shaft to make it easier 
to see.
